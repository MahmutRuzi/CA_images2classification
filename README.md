# CA_images2classification
This repo contains data,python code, and colab notebook to explore supervised machine learning algorisms for classification. I have explored the following supervised learning models: support vector machines, decision tree, and gradient boosting. 
The data comprised of 99 pictures and provided as a numpy array, showing water contact angle (CA) on a flat surface. Such pictures are commonly used for measuring the contact angle of liquid droplets on a flat surface. Each picture is 32 by 32 pixels, and belongs to one the three categories: superhydrophobic (CA>=150 degrees, label=2), hydrophobic (90 < CA < 150 degrees, label=1), and hydrophilic (CA<90 degrees, label=0).
