# CA_images2classification
This repo contains data,python code, and colab notebook to explore supervised machine learning algorisms for classification. 
The data is 99 pictures, showing water contact angle (CA) on a flat surface. Such pictures are commonly used for measuring the contact angle of liquid droplets on a flat surface. Each picture is 32 by 32 pixels, and belongs to one the three categories: superhydrophobic (CA>=150 degrees, label=2), hydrophobic(90 < CA < 150 degrees, label=1), and hydrophilic(CA<90 degrees, label=0).
